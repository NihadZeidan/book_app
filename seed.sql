The man goes out wearing make up and the woman draws a moustache on her face. But whilst the woman wants to hide away from the world, the man meets the stares from passers-by head on, compiling his Dictionary of Gazes to explore the boundaries between appearance and reality. The narrative of The Gaze is intertwined with the dwars dictionary entries and the story of a bizarre freak-show organized in Istanbul in the 1880s as the author considers the damage which can be inflicted by our simple desire to look at other people.');
